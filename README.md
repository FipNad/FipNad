Hello, my name in Filip-Ioan Ceara 

I am a communications and electronic and electrical engineering student at Military Technical Academy "Ferdinand I" Bucharest. 
I am also interested in machine learning and web developing. 
More, I find Arduino very interesting and I have been learning about it for the last weeks(how to use sensors, how to control them, how to send data to a Raspberry Pi to be processed).

You can contact me at filip.ceara@mta.ro
